- Enable a sustainable system for Stratify maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a `feature/XXX` branch from `develop`.
2. **If you've added code** that should be tested, add tests.
3. **If you've changed APIs**, update the documentation.
   - This includes README, KDocs, and any other associated documentation.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5. **Submit a pull request**.

## Style Guide

### Coding Standards

- Follow the [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) for all Kotlin code.
- Ensure that your code is well-tested.
- Write clear and meaningful commit messages.

### Commit Message Guidelines

- **Use the present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- **Use the imperative mood** ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- **Limit the first line to 72 characters or less**.
- **Reference issues and pull requests liberally** after the first line.

# Release Distribution
TBD - setting up github actions for generating zips for Maven Central manual upload

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

- `beginner`: Simple issues which should only require a few lines of code.
- `help-wanted`: Issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
- `bug`: An issue that reports a bug.
- `enhancement`: An issue that reports an enhancement.
